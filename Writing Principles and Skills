#### Writing Principles

## Normal Principles

    Don't  waste words, don't write rubbish.

## Nominalisation

In academic writing we tend to 'pack' a lot of information into noun phrases. Consider how the following simple sentences have been combined in the Horrigan et at reading:

    Sentence 1: Growth-promoting antibiotics are used in animal agriculture.  
    Sentence 2: These antibiotics are thought to be one of the factors driving the increase in antibiotic resistance in humans.

The use of growth-promoting antibiotics in animal agriculture is thought to be one of the factors driving the increase in antibiotic resistance in humans.  
The verb in the first sentence has become a noun - the use of growth-promoting antibiotics in animal agriculture.

This pattern of 'the X of Y' is common in complex noun phrases (where the verb in the original simple sentence becomes the 'X').

Examples

    Pesticides are used widely, Many target species develop resistance to the chemicals used against them.
    The wide use of pesticides may tend to drive the development of resistance to the chemicals used in the target species.
  
    Land is degraded by over-intensive agricultural practices so arable land per person has been declining steadily.  
    The degradation of land by over-intensive agricultural practices has result in a steady decline in the arable land per person.

    Crops use only 45% of irrigation water. Water use in irrigation is extremely inefficient.
    The inefficient consumption of water in irrigation accounts for 45%.

    Industrial agriculture is dependent on synthetic chemicals. This has reduced biodiversity in the insect world.
    The dependence on synthetic chemicals in industrial agriculture tends to result in a reduction in biodiversity.

    Industrial animal production creates threats to human health and the environment. It concentrates thousands of animals into crowded indoor facilities.
    The concentration of thousands animals into crowded indoor facilities industrial animal production tends to create threats to human health and environment.
