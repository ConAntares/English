#### Writing Principles

## Normal Principles

    Don't  waste words, don't write rubbish.

## Nominalisation

In academic writing we tend to 'pack' a lot of information into noun phrases. Consider how the following simple sentences have been combined in the Horrigan et at reading:

    Sentence 1: Growth-promoting antibiotics are used in animal agriculture.  
    Sentence 2: These antibiotics are thought to be one of the factors driving the increase in antibiotic resistance in humans.

The use of growth-promoting antibiotics in animal agriculture is thought to be one of the factors driving the increase in antibiotic resistance in humans.  
The verb in the first sentence has become a noun - the use of growth-promoting antibiotics in animal agriculture.

This pattern of 'the X of Y' is common in complex noun phrases (where the verb in the original simple sentence becomes the 'X').

# Examples

+ Carrying capacity is being reduced because the environment is being degraded.
→ Carrying capacity is being reduced because of environmental degradation.
* In this case we made the passive verb 'degraded' the noun and 'environment' became the adjective.
→ Carrying capacity is being reduced because of degradation of the environment.
* In this second case we also made the passive verb degrade a noun but put 'environment' in a prepositional phrase after it.

+ Human society is facing a large and rapid crash as a result of reduced carrying capacity.
→ Human society is facing a large and rapid crash as a result of a reduction in carrying capacity. 
→ Human society is facing a large and sudden crash as a result of reduced carrying capacity because of environmental degradation.

* Use 'lead to', 'result in'
+ A larger population obviously increases pressure on ecological resources. It also increases pressure on the ability of the ecosystem to continue to support the growing population.
→ A larger population obviously leads to increased pressure on ecological resources and increased pressure on the ability of the ecosystem to continue to support the growing population.
→ A larger population obviously leads to an increase in pressure on ecological resources and an increase in pressure on the ability of the ecosystem to continue to support the growing population.
→ A larger population obviously contributes to an increase in pressure on both ecological resources and the ability of the ecosystem to continue to support the growing population.

+ Energy production has increased since 1977 because population has risen and affluence (GDP) has risen.
→ Energy production has increased since 1977 with / because of rising population and rising affluence (GDP).
→ Energy production has presented an increase since 1977 with the growth in population and affluence (GDP).

+ Since 1950, population has grown and economic output has increased so global emissions of CO2 from fossil fuels has increased to about 33 gigatonnes per year.
* Hint – find the verbs in this sentence and change them to nouns or adjectives. ‘mean’ becomes the main verb in the new sentence
→ Since 1950, growing population and increasing economic output have meant an increase in global emissions of CO2 to about 33 gigatonnes per year.
→ Since 1950, the growth of 

+ Pesticides are used widely, Many target species develop resistance to the chemicals used against them.
→ The wide use of pesticides may tend to drive the development of resistance to the chemicals used in the target species.
  
+ Land is degraded by over-intensive agricultural practices so arable land per person has been declining steadily.  
→ The degradation of land by over-intensive agricultural practices has result in a steady decline in the arable land per person.

+ Crops use only 45% of irrigation water. Water use in irrigation is extremely inefficient.
→ The inefficient consumption of water in irrigation accounts for 45%.

+ Industrial agriculture is dependent on synthetic chemicals. This has reduced biodiversity in the insect world.
→ The dependence on synthetic chemicals in industrial agriculture tends to result in a reduction in biodiversity.

+ Industrial animal production creates threats to human health and the environment. It concentrates thousands of animals into crowded indoor facilities.
→ The concentration of thousands animals into crowded indoor facilities industrial animal production tends to create threats to human health and environment.
