# Give two different views on the reasons for obesity and chronic disease.

The first view, which seems to be the prevailing view of Western governments, is that these health issues are the result of individual choice. 
Johnson (2015) calls this “conventional wisdom.” Johnson notes that this perspective has resulted in attempts to address the problems by trying to persuade individuals to reduce their food intake and to exercise more,  in campaigns both in Australia and the US, most of which have been unsuccessful. 
This is a very attractive position for governments to take, since it blames the people for a problem that many analysts believe is the result of the food system, 
the environment in which people buy and consume food (Freudenberg et.al. & Walls et.al., cited in Johnson, 2015).

A second viewpoint is that the food system, especially factors associated with the nutrition transition, is the main reason for these serious health issues. 
For example, because the most nutritious foods tend to be more expensive for a variety of reasons, 
the lower socioeconomic group will be attracted by the cheaper staples and processed foods (De Schutter, 2012; Johnson, 2015). 
When a significant proportion of a family’s income is spent on food, this price gap can be critical. 
In developing countries, Johnson notes that traditional markets lose custom to the new supermarkets, and Western food fads tend to become popular. 

Consequently, many people have little choice. Their traditional sources of nutrition disappear or become too expensive, 
and obesity and non-communicable diseases become common.
