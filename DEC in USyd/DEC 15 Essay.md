## Introduction

The primary factor contributes to the problem of sustainable development in the food industry is the management methods, which are embodied in industrial agriculture and associated with climate change. The traditional agriculture industry disassociates the interrelated parts, and leads to obscure the negative impact on humans, natural resources, and the environment. Within the modern market economy, enterprises are driven by profit. This logic results in the concentration of wealth and power inexorably, even ecosystem disruption. Recent decades have witnessed an evident development of both economy and population, which demonstrates a severe challenge for our agriculture industry. The improvement of industrial system is required to provide us sufficient material basis. An alternative, as a relational approach, agroecology is emerging which aims to resolve this crisis.
