# An Introduction to Agroecology

Lu Niu

## Introduction

The primary factor contributes to the problem of sustainable development in the food industry is the management methods, which are embodied in industrial agriculture and associated with climate change. The traditional agriculture industry disassociates the interrelated parts, and leads to obscure the negative impact on humans, natural resources, and the environment. Within the modern market economy, enterprises are driven by profit. This logic results in the concentration of wealth and power inexorably, even ecosystem disruption. Recent decades have witnessed an evident development of both economy and population, which demonstrates a severe challenge for agriculture industry.  



The industrial system does not and cannot meet our food needs. An alternative, relational approach—agroecology—is emerging and has already shown promising success on the ground. By dispersing power and building on farmers’ own knowledge, it offers a viable path to healthy, accessible food; environmental protection; and enhanced human dignity.
