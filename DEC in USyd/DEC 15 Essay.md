# An Introduction to Agroecology

Our planet is facing varies inter-related crises including resource and ecology. Miguel A. Altieri(2015) reports that these problems do not evolve spontaneously but are a result of an industrial system that pursuit economic profit at the expense of nature and people. Among these problems, the problem of sustainable development represents one component of ecological problem. The primary factor contributes to this component in the food industry is its management methods, which are embodied in industrial agriculture and associated with climate change. The traditional agriculture industry disassociates the interrelated dimensions, and leads to obscure the negative impact on humans, natural resources, and the environment. Within the modern market economy, enterprises are driven by profit. This logic results in the concentration of wealth and power inexorably, even ecosystem disruption. Recent decades have witnessed an evident development of both economy and population, which demonstrates a severe challenge for our agriculture industry, In particular, there is a conflict between increased crop production and incremental hunger has impact the world obviously.The improvement of industrial system is required to provide us sufficient material basis. The International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development(IAASTD) analyses this phenomenon as "business as usual is no longer an option". An alternative, as a relational approach, agroecology is emerging which aims to resolve this crisis. IAASTD concludes our agriculture should depend on biodiversity, and agroecology methods can meet economical, and environmental requirements as well as maintain the increase of productivity.

Agroecology is defined as the study of ecological processes applied to agricultural systems. Agroecology is inherently multidisciplinary, it associates with sociology, agricultural technology, and productivity. Agroecology is defined by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD) as "the study of the relation of agricultural crops and environment." T. Dalgaard refer to agroecology as the study of the interactions between plants, animals, humans, and the environment in agricultural systems. It uses different technologies and principles to analysis elements of ecosystem, such as interactions between soil properties and plant-insect, as well as using social sciences to analyses the impacts of farming practices on rural economy, productivity and economic situation to developing new production methods, or cultural factors on farming practices.

Agroecology has rooted in ecology, applying the principles and technologies of natural ecosystem and comparing these to mechanized agroecosystem. P. Wojtkowski report that ecology can be differentiated the ecology of natural ecosystems with agroecology. Although economics has no contribution to the functioning of natural systems, economics can determine the development of agroecology. He also points that humans are the prime force for organisms within planned and managed environments, and discuss the details of application of agroecology in agriculture, forestry, and agroforestry in his book published in 2002. M. Altieri asserts that the kernel of agroecology strategy is that the agroecosystem should mimic the functions, structure, and characteristics of local ecosystem, thus exhibiting tight nutrient cycling, complex structure and enhanced biodiversity. It was designed with some expectations which include such conservative of nutrients and insect resistance. Applying the agroecology allows development of agroecosystem with minimal dependency on resource inputs and energy, paying attention to interactions and synergisms among the multiple biological parts of agroecosystems to enhance utilization efficiency of agricultural resources and biological self-regulation, thus improving overall ecological efficiency and environmental sustainable development. 

An important factor of agroecology in supporting sustainable agriculture is to reincorporate biodiversity into agriculture system. The strategy of agroecology can provide us diversity and flexibility on agriculture productivity, This diversification is reported by M. Altieri that it can both generate variety mixtures, rotations, polycultures, agroforestry, crop-livestock integration, etc., and give farmers a wide variety of options to assemble spatial and temporal combinations. 

According to the above principles, M. Alteieri concludes that agroecology is based on the application of the following five principles: 
1. Enhance biological circulation system, optimizing resource and energy availability, and balancing nutrient population and flow;
2. Secure favourable soil conditions for plant growth, especially by optimizing organic matter and enhancing soil biotic activity;
3. Reduce losses due to flows of solar radiation, air, and water by the technological approaches of microclimate, water harvesting, and soil management through increased soil cover rate.
4. Species and ecological diversity of agroecosystem in time, space, other factors at the landscape and field level.
5. Enhance positive biological interactions and synergisms among agricultural components, thus providing the promoting effects on ecological processes, services, and production.

These principles take technological forms on specific agriculture practices in order to be applied.
