# An Introduction to Agroecology

Lu Niu

Our planet is facing varies inter-related crises including resource and ecology. Miguel A. Altieri(2015) reports that these problems do not evolve spontaneously but are a result of an industrial system that pursuit economic profit at the expense of nature and people. Among these problems, the problem of sustainable development represents one component of ecological problem. The primary factor contributes to this component in the food industry is its management methods, which are embodied in industrial agriculture and associated with climate change. The traditional agriculture industry disassociates the interrelated dimensions, and leads to obscure the negative impact on humans, natural resources, and the environment. Within the modern market economy, enterprises are driven by profit. This logic results in the concentration of wealth and power inexorably, even ecosystem disruption. Recent decades have witnessed an evident development of both economy and population, which demonstrates a severe challenge for our agriculture industry, In particular, there is a conflict between increased crop production and incremental hunger has impact the world obviously.The improvement of industrial system is required to provide us sufficient material basis. The International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development(IAASTD) analyses this phenomenon as "business as usual is no longer an option". An alternative, as a relational approach, agroecology is emerging which aims to resolve this crisis. IAASTD concludes our agriculture should depend on biodiversity, and agroecology methods can meet economical, and environmental requirements as well as maintain the increase of productivity.

Agroecology is defined as the study of ecological processes applied to agricultural systems. It associates with sociology, agricultural technology, and productivity.
