Altieri(2015) reports that these problems do not evolve spontaneously but are a result of an industrial system that pursuit economic profit at the expense of nature and people. Among these problems, the problem of sustainable development represents one component of ecological problem. The primary factor contributes to this component in the food industry is its management methods, which are embodied in industrial agriculture and associated with climate change. The traditional agriculture industry disassociates the interrelated dimensions, and leads to obscure the negative impact on humans, natural resources, and the environment.

Recent decades have witnessed an evident development of both economy and population, which demonstrates a severe challenge for our agriculture industry, In particular, there is a conflict between increased crop production and incremental hunger has impact the world obviously.The improvement of industrial system is required to provide us sufficient material basis. An alternative, as a relational approach, agroecology is emerging which aims to resolve this crisis. 

The International Assessment og Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development(IAASTD) analyses this phenomenon and 

Agroecology is the method
