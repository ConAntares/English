# An Introduction to Agroecology

Lu Niu

## Introduction

The primary factor contributes to the problem of sustainable development in the food industry is the management methods, which is embodied in industrial agriculture and associated with climate change. The traditional agriculture industry disassociates the interrelated parts, and leads to obscure the negative impact this approach has on humans, natural resources, and the environment. Within so-called free market economics, enterprise is driven by the central goal of bringing the highest return to existing wealth. This logic leads inexorably to the concentration of wealth and power, making hunger and ecosystem disruption inevitable. The industrial system does not and cannot meet our food needs. An alternative, relational approach—agroecology—is emerging and has already shown promising success on the ground. By dispersing power and building on farmers’ own knowledge, it offers a viable path to healthy, accessible food; environmental protection; and enhanced human dignity.
